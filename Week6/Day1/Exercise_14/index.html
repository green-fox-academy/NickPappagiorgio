          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell
          who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you
          and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

          You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got
          a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.

          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional
          period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides,
          I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
